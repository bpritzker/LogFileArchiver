Welcome to the Archiver bean.
A very simple bean (or cron job) to archive files.

right click on the "pom.xml" and select "Run As->Maven Build as..." for the Goal put "package" 
You should then see in you target directory "logfilearchiver-X.X.X.war"
Just copy that to your JBoss deployments dir and you are gtg (good to go)

If something doesn't work or you want enhancements let me know.

If you find the program useful please let me know. Would love to hear that anyone else 
used this lol :)

Good luck and have fun,
Ben
