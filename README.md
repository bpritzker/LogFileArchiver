Welcome to the Deployment Utilities.
This is designed to be an easy way to archive/clean up old files, specifically log files.




right click on the "pom.xml" and select "Run As->Maven Build as..." for the Goal put "package" 
You should then see in you target directory "logfilearchiver-X.X.X.war"
Just copy that to your JBoss deployments dir and you are gtg (good to go)

If something doesn't work or you want enhancements let me know.

If you find the program useful please let me know. Would love to hear that anyone else 
used this lol :)

Good luck and have fun,
Ben



To Run the full tests locally you will need to change the Testing Global file.
